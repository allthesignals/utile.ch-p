					<p class="main">The Boston City Hall and Plaza Study is a one-year comprehensive planning process, linked to several recent and ongoing initiatives.</p>

					<p>Mayor Martin J. Walsh has devised a holistic approach that includes a call for big ideas, near term experiments, and a search for enthusiastic partners, all grounded by a comprehensive planning process. The plan will combine innovative design thinking with a workable implementation approach. This effort will learn from the spring Twitter campaign and successful temporary installations on the Plaza, combined with a hard look at the state of the building systems, strategies for creating a greener environment, and ways that the functions of City Hall can be reorganized into more welcoming, engaging and collaborative spaces.  </p>

						<h2>It's Not 1968 Anymore</h2>

						<p>City Hall first opened in 1968. At the time, all record keeping and transactions were done with paper. File cabinets filled the lower levels of the building, clerks pushed carts through corridors, and the citizens of Boston lined up at dozens of identical concrete transaction counters to do business ranging from paying parking tickets to getting marriage licenses. As the City transforms more of these transactions and record-keeping functions to digital space, why do people still come to City Hall? We want to create an accessible, meaningful and uplifting experience for the full range of these interactions, whether they are one-on-one meetings to seek advice, raucous public meetings, or one of life’s important milestones.</p>

						<p>At the same time, the typical office environment has radically changed since 1968. Creative work is now done in open office environments with a wide range of informal breakout spaces and meeting rooms. City government will be more innovative if we can convert the administrative areas of City Hall into spaces that promote equal access, collaboration and creativity. </p>

					<h2>Integrating Innovative Design Thinking and a Viable Business Approach</h2>

					<p>In conventional feasibility studies, design proposals are proposed and then priced. This kind of process often results in sticker shock and the realization that funding sources are not available to implement the project. Processes like these have been the undoing of several previous attempts to reimagine City Hall and the Plaza. </p>

					<p>The City has devised a strategic process for Rethink City Hall! that seamlessly integrates innovative design thinking with a viable business approach. The proposed schedule reverses typical master planning processes and explores potential implementation and revenue strategies before illustrating specific physical design proposals.</p>

					<h2>A Three-phase Planning Process</h2>

					<p>Our approach organizes the City Hall master planning process into three phases. Each phase includes a clearly articulated series of tasks for the consultant team and a corresponding decision needed from the City.</p>

					<p>Phase One will establish the business plan for the potential realignment of City-owned property, the reorganization of administrative departments, and financing approaches. Phase Two will convert the business plan into several alternative design scenarios, resulting in the selection of a preferred scheme. In Phase Three, the preferred approach will be developed, resulting in compelling visual material, a project budget, and an implementation plan. Phase One is scheduled from mid-October 2015 until mid-January 2016, Phase Two is scheduled from mid-January through mid-June 2016, and Phase Three is scheduled from mid-June through mid-September 2016.</p>

					<h2>Research and data analysis will help shape the opportunities</h2>

					<p>Phase One of the planning process includes four simultaneous tasks that together will shape the design approach in Phases Two and Three. </p>

					<h3>Balancing potential revenue sources and ambitions</h3>

					<p>The project team will explore alternative revenue sources for a capital project. Areas of focus include the disposition of city-owned real estate, public/private partnerships, and conventional capital project funding sources.</p>

					<h3>Programming and space planning</h3>

					<p>The project team will explore programming and space planning scenarios for city administrative departments across the City’s entire portfolio, but with a specific focus on City Hall, 26 Court Street, Hawkins Street, and 1010 Massachusetts Avenue.</p>

					<h3>Historic understanding and opportunities</h3>

					<p>The consultant team will identify the original design elements that need to be maintained as well as opportunities for adaptive reuse.</p>

					<h3>Existing conditions analysis</h3>

					<p>The project team will analyze the spatial organization and building systems of City Hall. What are the must-do improvements because of failing building systems and accessibility issues? What sustainable technologies can be utilized to improve building efficiencies and create a healthier environment? </p>
